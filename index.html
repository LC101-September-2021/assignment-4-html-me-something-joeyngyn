            <p>
               Hello, my name is Joey and I am one of the owners of AJ Nail alongside my parents Anthony and Mary. <br>
               What started out as a dream of my parents ended up being the seed that blossomed my drive and passion for entrepreneurship. <br>
               Thankfully, I had a starting ground in this nail salon which I was able to help them create a loyal customer base as well as become recognized as the go-to small business within the area. <br>
               With this HTML-Me assignment I am hoping that this can set a foundation for me to build a website off of for the salon in the near future!

            <h3>Dance</h3>
            <p>
               Aside from business and entrepreneurship, one of the things I am very passionate about is dancing. <br>
               When my friend introduced me to the world of Korean Pop Music in 2009~2010, I had no idea that it would, not only introduce me to the world of dancing, but also to some of the connections and friendships that I still have to this day. <br>
               Shortly after learning about this new world, I would have a lip-syncing assignment for my 7th grade English course as the teacher's take on public speaking. <br>
               Not knowing where to start, I remember that one of my favorite K-Pop songs at the time had just released an English version. <br> 
               I would spend countless hours teaching myself the dance through tutorial videos and the artist's live performances on YouTube. <br>
               Fast forward to college and I was still dancing, however, I was on a team this time. <br>
               We traveled and performed all over the Midwest area (places such as Chicago, St. Louis, Indiana, etc.) as well as picking up various accolades along the way. <br>
               By the end of my college career, our team had gone from a group of friends who shared a mutual love of dancing and K-Pop to being, not just a multi-award winning dance team, but at one point, one of the best, if not the best in the St. Louis - Missouri area. <br>
               Some of our accomplishments include: 
               <ul>
                  <li>1st Place - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Missouri - 2x</li>
                  <li>2nd Place - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Missouri </li>
                  <li>1st Place - Saint Louis University International Gala Talent Show - 2x</li>
                  <li>Top 4 - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Chicago - 2x</li>
                  <li>Reaching over 100k+ views on YouTube</li>
               </ul>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
               Dancing and music go hand in hand so it was only a matter of time before I started developing a passion for music.<br>
               As my dancing grew outside the realm of K-Pop and into Urban Hip-Hop, I started to really develope a love for the Rap, Pop, and R&B genres of music. <br>
               I've always found music as an outlet, whether it be through dancing or just driving and listening to music to clear my head. I have found that making and writing music is another way for me to engage in this outlet. <br>
               This passion is something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life if I ever got the chance.

            <h3>Photography and Fashion</h3>
            <p>
               As someone who likes to create and capture memories, I found myself doing photoshoots, whether it be for myself or family and friends.  <br>
               Whether it be photoshoots or performing on stage, I always want to look my best. Therefore, I am very passionate about fashion. <br>
               I believe that a person can show themselves off by the clothes they wear. If you look your best, then you feel your best. <br>
