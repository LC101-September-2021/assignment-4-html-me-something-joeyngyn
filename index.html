            <p>
               Hello, my name is Joey and I am one of the owners of AJ Nail along side my parents Anthony and Mary. <br>
               What started out as a dream of my parents ended up being the seed that blossomed my drive and passion for entrepreneurship. <br>
               Thankfully, I had a starting ground in this nail salon which I was able to help them create a loyal customer base as well as become recognized as the go-to small business within the area. <br>

            <h2>Dance</h2>
            <p>
               Aside from business and entrepreneurship, one of the things I am very passionate about is dancing. <br>
               When my friend introduced me to the world of Korean Pop Music in 2009~2010, I had no idea that it would, not only introduce me to the world of dancing, but also to some of the connections and friendships that I still have to this day. <br>
               Shortly after learning about this new world, I would have a lip-syncing assignment for my 7th grade English course as the teacher's take on public speaking. <br>
               Not knowing where to start, I remember that one of my favorite K-Pop songs at the time had just released an English version. <br> 
               I would spend countless hours teaching myself the dance through tutorial videos and the artist's live performances on YouTube. <br>
               Fast forward to college and I was still dancing, however, I was on a team this time. <br>
               We traveled and performed all over the Midwest area (places such as Chicago, St. Louis, Indiana, etc.) as well as picking up various accolades along the way.
               By the end of my college career, our team had gone from a group of friends who shared a mutual love of dancing and K-Pop to being, not just a multi-award winning dance team, but at one point, one of the best, if not the best in the St. Louis - Missouri area. <br>
               Some of our accomplishments include: 
               <ul>
                  <li>1st Place - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Missouri - 2x</li>
                  <li>2nd Place - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Missouri </li>
                  <li>1st Place - Saint Louis University International Gala Talent Show - 2x</li>
                  <li>Top 4 - Taste of Korea Music Festival: Chicago - 2x</li>
                  <li>Reaching over 100k+ views on YouTube</li>
               </ul>
